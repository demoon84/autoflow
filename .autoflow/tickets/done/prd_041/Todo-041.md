## Allowed Paths

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`

## Worktree
- Path: `/Users/demoon/Documents/project/.autoflow-worktrees/autoflow/Todo-041`
- Branch: autoflow/Todo-041
- Base Commit: 68d3f152c222f01ca9e8e326f8954fd1b8c2f0e8
- Worktree Commit: 4771f1cd1a57915cab6defe44c69ecdabb4fb0c6
- Integration Status: integrated

## Done When

- [x] In `settingsNavigation`, the `progress` item with label `작업` appears before `kanban`, `knowledge`, and `snapshot`.
- [x] The `progress` item keeps the same key, label, and `Workflow` icon.
- [x] The `kanban`, `knowledge`, and `snapshot` navigation items keep their existing keys, labels, and icons.
- [x] No styles, runner logic, board data logic, or ticket workspace behavior changes.
- [x] The implementation stays inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`.

## Next Action
- Complete: the inline merge finalizer integrated the AI-merged ticket, archived evidence, and prepared the local completion commit.

## Resume Context

- 현재 상태 요약: Plan AI 가 `memo_012` 를 generated PRD `prd_041` 로 승격하고, 단일 파일 todo 티켓을 생성했다.
- 직전 작업: wiki query 를 `Move Work menu item to top`, `left sidebar Work menu item`, `작업 메뉴`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`, `desktop navigation order` 로 실행했고, `scripts/start-plan.sh` 가 PRD 와 memo 를 `tickets/done/prd_041/` 로 보관하고 이 todo 티켓을 만들었다.
- 재개 시 먼저 볼 것: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` 의 `settingsNavigation` 배열.

## Notes

- Created by planner-1 (Plan AI) from tickets/done/prd_041/prd_041.md at 2026-04-28T21:07:39Z.
- Planning constraint: keep this as a navigation-order-only edit in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`; do not change labels, icons, styling, routing, runner logic, ticket workspace behavior, or board data handling.
- Wiki context: `./bin/autoflow wiki query . --term "Move Work menu item to top" --term "left sidebar Work menu item" --term "작업 메뉴" --term "apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx" --term "desktop navigation order" --limit 10` surfaced recent related Desktop renderer tickets including `tickets/done/prd_036/Todo-036.md`, `tickets/done/prd_028/Todo-028.md`, and `tickets/done/prd_040/prd_040.md`. This ticket should stay narrow to avoid overlap with adjacent `main.tsx` work.

- Mini-plan by worker-1 at 2026-04-28T21:14:12Z:
  1. Keep scope limited to `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` and only reorder `settingsNavigation`.
  2. Move `{ key: "progress", label: "작업", icon: Workflow }` before `kanban` without changing any keys, labels, icons, styles, routing, runner logic, or board data logic.
  3. Verify by inspecting the array order and running `npm --prefix apps/desktop run check`.
- Wiki context: repeat query for `settingsNavigation` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` returned `tickets/done/prd_036/prd_036.md`, `tickets/done/prd_036/Todo-036.md`, `tickets/done/prd_040/Todo-040.md`, and `tickets/done/prd_028/Todo-028.md`; these reinforce that adjacent `main.tsx` work is frequent and this turn must stay navigation-order-only.
- Implementation note by worker-1 at 2026-04-28T21:15:00Z: reordered only `settingsNavigation` so `progress`/`작업` is first; manually applied the same patch to PROJECT_ROOT. PROJECT_ROOT had pre-existing unrelated `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` changes, so only the ticket patch was staged for this ticket.
- Prepared worktree commit 4771f1cd1a57915cab6defe44c69ecdabb4fb0c6 at 2026-04-28T21:16:34Z; Impl AI integrates it into PROJECT_ROOT and the inline finalizer creates the local completion commit.
- Impl AI worker-1 marked verification pass at 2026-04-28T21:16:34Z; runtime finalizer will not perform merge operations.
- Merge finalizer verified at 2026-04-28T21:16:34Z: AI already integrated worktree commit 4771f1cd1a57915cab6defe44c69ecdabb4fb0c6 into PROJECT_ROOT; script performed no rebase or cherry-pick.
- Inline merge finalizer (worker worker-1) finalized this verified ticket at 2026-04-28T21:16:34Z.
- Coordinator post-merge cleanup at 2026-04-28T21:16:34Z: removed_worktree=/Users/demoon/Documents/project/.autoflow-worktrees/autoflow/Todo-041 deleted_branch=autoflow/Todo-041.
